# 2PC_eq_cmp

need [libOTe](https://github.com/osu-crypto/libOTe)

then change the line 17 in CMakeLists.txt to find libOTe.
```
set(CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH "/path/to/libOTe")
```


```bash
mkdir build
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build --parallel
```

To Run the code, use this in two shells. 

```bash
./build/eq_cmp -sender -n 100000 -l 4 -c 0
./build/eq_cmp -receiver -n 100000 -l 4 -c 0 
# will do equality test of 100000 4-bit numbers

./build/eq_cmp -sender -n 100000 -l 4 -c 1
./build/eq_cmp -receiver -n 100000 -l 4 -c 1

-n the number will be comparision or equality test
-l the bit of the number to be calculated
-c the type will be calculated, 0 means equality test, 1 means comparision
-ip mean the ip address, default is localhost:1213
```
